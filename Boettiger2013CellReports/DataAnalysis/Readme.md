## Introduction

This folder contains code used in my publication:

> Boettiger, A. N. & Levine, M. Rapid Transcription Fosters Coordinate snail Expression in the Drosophila Embryo. Cell reports 3, 8â€“15 (2013).

These files were used to process the mRNA counting results produced by the code described in the `ImageAnalysis` folder.  They depend upon raw data files produced by that code to run successfully.  These `.mat` files are too large to include in the repository, but you may write to me to request files.

## Files
* MeasureSnaGradient.m - orients snail gradients along a common axis and computes spatial averages for later plotting. 
* MakeFigure1.m - plots the images in Figure 1
* MakeFigure2.m - plots the data in Figure 2
* MakeFigure3.m  - plots the data in Figure 3
* MakeFigure4.m - plots the data in Figure 4

## Functions
* plotstackdots.m - function required by MakeFigure1.m
* Functions in the `ImageAnalysis` directory are also called by scripts and functiosn in this directory, so you will want both in you filepath.




*Note: This readme is written in markdown.  It should be text-readable as well, but will look better if you view it with a markdown compiler.  Github automatically compiles and renders markdown.
