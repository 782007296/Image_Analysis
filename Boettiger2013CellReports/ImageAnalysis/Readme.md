## Introduction
This folder contains the code used in my publication:

> Boettiger, A. N. & Levine, M. Rapid Transcription Fosters Coordinate snail Expression in the Drosophila Embryo. Cell reports 3, 8â€“15 (2013).

as it stood on the date of publication.  For version history, browse the version history of the parent directory Image_Analysis.

## Main Analysis Files
* `imviewer_LSM.fig`  - GUI for extracting TIF Files from lsm image stacks
* `Im_nucseg.fig` - GUI for extracting nuclear map and partitioning cytoplasm between nuclei.
* `Unsupervised_DotFinding.m` - script which proccesses the Tif stack indicated and counts all the mRNA spots detected

## Functions
* `fxn_nuc_seg.m` - subroutine of `Im_nuc_eg.fig`, identifies the nuclei in the image
* `fxn_nuc_reg.m` - subroutine of `Im_nucseg.fig`, performs cytoplasmic segmentation 
* `dotfinder.m` - subroutine of `Unsupervised_DotFiding.m`, localizes spots
* `CheckDotUpDown.m` - subroutine of `Unsupervised_DotFinding.m`, links dots between Z-stacks
* `AssignDots.m` - subroutine of `Unsupervised_DotFinding.m`, Assigns dots to nuclei.  
* `jacquestiffread.m` - subroutine of `imviewer_LSM.fig`, parses Zeiss LSM headerfiles
* `read_planeT.m - subroutine of `imviewer_LSM.fig`
* `imreadfast.m` - faster version of imread assumes image is a Tif file.  Used in several files
* `makeuint.m` - covert any data to uint of desired bit size and rescale pixel values to use max dynamic range.
