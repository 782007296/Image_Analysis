## Introduction
This folder contains the code used in my publication:

> Boettiger, A. N. & Levine, M. Rapid Transcription Fosters Coordinate snail Expression in the Drosophila Embryo. Cell reports 3, 8â€“15 (2013).

as it stood on the date of publication.  For version history, browse the version history of the parent directory Image_Analysis.

## Main Analysis Files
* imviewer\_LSM.fig  - GUI for extracting TIF Files from lsm image stacks
* Im\_nucseg.fig - GUI for extracting nuclear map and partitioning cytoplasm between nuclei.
* Unsupervised_DotFinding.m - script which proccesses the Tif stack indicated and counts all the mRNA spots detected

## Functions
* fxn\_nuc\_seg.m - subroutine of Im_nuc_seg.fig, identifies the nuclei in the image
* fxn\_nuc\_reg.m - subroutine of Image_nuc_seg.fig, performs cytoplasmic segmentation 
* dotfinder.m - subroutine of Unsupervised_DotFiding.m, localizes spots
* CheckDotUpDown.m - subroutine of Unsupervised_DtoFinding.m, links dots between Z-stacks
* jacquestiffread.m - subroutine of imviewer_LSM, parses Zeiss LSM headerfiles
* imreadfast.m - faster version of imread assumes image is a Tif file.  Used in several files
* makeuint.m - covert any data to uint of desired bit size and rescale pixel values to use max dynamic range.
